"""Static cost model for the governance contract's vote and execute paths.

Issue #54 asks for governance gas profiling: instruction counts and event
bytes for 10-signer multi-sig operations, with multi-sig voting under 1M CPU
instructions per vote.

**This script does not measure instructions.** It cannot. Instruction counts
come from `soroban-env-host`'s metering, which requires executing the contract
on a host. Instead it derives the *operation counts* that metering charges for
- storage reads, storage writes, TTL bumps, ledger reads and event emissions -
by reading `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs` and resolving the helper call
graph of each entrypoint.

Operation counts are the honest, checkable part of the question. They are
deterministic, derived from the source, and they are what actually determines
whether a path stays inside a ledger's limits. A `cargo test` benchmark that
reports raw instruction counts is still required before quoting a number; this
script exists so that benchmark has a second, independent check to agree with,
and so the *shape* of the cost is documented rather than guessed.

What it does:

  1. Parse `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs`.
  2. Build a call graph over the contract's free helper functions.
  3. For `propose`, `approve` and `execute`, walk the graph and count the leaf
     storage operations, separating the steady-state cost of a vote from the
     quorum-reaching branch in `approve`.
  4. Check the structural claims that matter for scaling: that per-vote cost
     does not grow with the number of signers, and that the approval index is
     a Map lookup (O(1)) rather than a scan of the approvals Vec (O(n)).

Exit codes: 0 = all checks pass, 1 = a check failed, 2 = could not run.
