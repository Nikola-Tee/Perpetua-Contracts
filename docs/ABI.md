# Perpetua ABI — interface of record

**Status: FROZEN as of 2026-08-12, ahead of stage 5.**

This document is the interface contract between `Perpetua-Contracts` and every
consumer — `Perpetua-Backend`, `Perpetua-Frontend`, `fluxora-sdk`, and third-party
integrators. Anything not described here is not part of the interface.

| | |
|---|---|
| Protocol | 27 |
| SDK | `soroban-sdk` 27.0.5 |
| Testnet contract | `CBCGTSCJXBMPPPE4BPDIPYZXPE2J5TQEKD2KCS7VQF533NKKEYGUTHXW` |
| Wasm hash | `d47c96a344a79c614ab0dcf0eac62cc9384f6dc7f1d45c3f5109fb09658b035e` |
| Interface spec sha256 | `acdfd259c7f9a854d42c5da4cda43138fb71b757b604a21c6dac8a8a5a3a86d1` |

The deployed contract's interface has been verified byte-identical to the local
build:

```bash
stellar contract info interface --wasm contracts/stream/target/wasm32v1-none/release/fluxora_stream.wasm
stellar contract info interface --id CBCGTSCJ… --network testnet
```

## What "frozen" means

The core contract is **immutable** — no admin key, no upgrade path (see the
non-goals). The interface therefore cannot change on the deployed contract at
all; a change means a *new deployment at a new address*.

So the freeze is a commitment about how we manage that:

* **Compatible** (no version bump): adding a field to the *end* of an event
  payload; adding a new error discriminant; adding a new entry point in a future
  deployment.
* **Breaking** (new address, new major version, migration note): renaming or
  removing an entry point; changing any parameter's type, order or count;
  renaming a struct field; reordering event topics; renumbering an existing
  error discriminant; changing the meaning of a field.

Consumers should pin the wasm hash above and treat a change in it as requiring
a review of this document.

**Generate, do not hand-write.** Event and function schemas are embedded in the
deployed contract via `#[contractevent]` and `#[contractimpl]`. The SDK and
indexer must codegen from `stellar contract info interface`, not from
hand-rolled topic parsers. The previous frontend's hand-written
`nativeToScVal` encoding is exactly the thing that broke; see
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

The reviewable inventory of every public method, return type, error
discriminant and event is generated from that same spec XDR and committed at
[`contracts/stream/abi/fluxora_stream.json`](../contracts/stream/abi/fluxora_stream.json).
`test::abi` fails the suite if a method is removed, renamed, or type-changed
without bumping [`ABI_VERSION`](../contracts/stream/src/lib.rs). Additive
changes update the snapshot only.

---

## Types

### `Stream`

```rust
struct Stream {
    sender: Address,
    recipient: Address,
    token: Address,        // SEP-41. Per-stream, NOT a contract-wide setting.
    deposited: i128,       // total ever deposited, including top-ups
    withdrawn: i128,       // total ever withdrawn by the recipient
    start_time: u64,       // unix seconds
    end_time: u64,         // unix seconds
    cliff_time: u64,       // in [start_time, end_time]; == start_time for none
    cancellable: bool,     // immutable after creation
    pausable: bool,        // immutable after creation
    transferable: bool,    // immutable after creation
    paused_at: Option<u64>,
    paused_total: u64,     // cumulative paused seconds, excluding any in-progress pause
    status: StreamStatus,
}
```

All amounts are `i128` in the token's smallest unit. **USDC on Stellar has 7
decimals** — not 6, not 18. Amounts cross the JSON-RPC boundary as *strings*
(`"600000000"`), not numbers; a client that parses them as IEEE doubles will
silently lose precision above 2^53.

### `StreamStatus`

Crosses the ABI as its **discriminant**, not its name.

| value | name | terminal | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | `Active` | no | accruing |
| `1` | `Paused` | no | accrual clock frozen; withdrawal still permitted |
| `2` | `Cancelled` | yes | sender clawed back the unvested remainder |
| `3` | `Depleted` | yes | ran to term and was fully withdrawn |

`Cancelled` is **sticky**: a cancelled stream later drained to zero stays
`Cancelled`. It never becomes `Depleted`. This distinction is deliberate and
load-bearing for reporting — see the resolved schema question below.

### `Error`

Discriminants are ABI and are never renumbered; new variants are appended.

| # | name | | # | name |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `StreamNotFound` | | 14 | `StreamTerminated` |
| 2 | `InvalidTimeRange` | | 15 | `StreamMatured` |
| 3 | `InvalidCliff` | | 16 | `InsufficientWithdrawable` |
| 4 | `InvalidDeposit` | | 17 | `NothingToWithdraw` |
| 5 | `DepositRateTooLow` | | 18 | `InvalidAmount` |
| 6 | `SelfStream` | | 19 | `BatchTooLarge` |
| 7 | `Unauthorized` | | 20 | `EmptyBatch` |
| 8 | `NotCancellable` | | 21 | `DuplicateStreamId` |
| 9 | `NotPausable` | | 22 | `Overflow` |
| 10 | `NotTransferable` | | 23 | `TopUpTooSmall` |
| 11 | `StreamNotActive` | | 24 | `StreamIdExhausted` |
| 12 | `StreamNotPaused` | | 25 | `TokenTransferFailed` |
| 13 | `StreamAlreadyPaused` | | 26 | `TokenMissing` |
| | | | 27 | `DelegateNotPermitted` |
| | | | 28 | `DelegateExpired` |
| | | | 29 | `MalformedStreamId` |
| | | | 30 | `RepeatedTransfer` |
| | | | 31 | `InvalidTopUp` |

`TokenTransferFailed` (25) and `TokenMissing` (26) are **stable stream-level categories** for token sub-invocation failures. The token contract's internal error discriminant is intentionally discarded — forwarding it would produce a value clients decode against Perpetua's error table, yielding a silent misinterpretation. The raw diagnostic is visible in the failed transaction's `diagnosticEvents`.

* `TokenTransferFailed` — the token contract returned a typed contract error: insufficient sender balance, pool underfunded on a payout, or the token's own authorization rules refused the call.
* `TokenMissing` — the token address resolves to nothing (Abort / host trap); the stream references a non-deployed contract.

The CLI and RPC render these as `Error(Contract, #N)`.

`StreamNotActive` (11) is reserved in the frozen ABI; current entry points
return the more specific pause/terminated variants instead.

`withdraw` distinguishes empty balances: a live stream with nothing accrued
yet returns `NothingToWithdraw` (17); a `Cancelled` or `Depleted` stream with
nothing left returns `StreamTerminated` (14). Clients must not treat those as
equivalent.

## Entry points

### Lifecycle

| function | auth | returns |
|---|---|---|
| `create_stream(sender, recipient, token, deposit, start_time, end_time, cliff_time, cancellable, pausable, transferable)` | sender | `u64` stream id |
| `top_up(stream_id, amount)` | sender | — |
| `withdraw(stream_id, amount: Option<i128>)` | recipient | `i128` paid |
| `batch_withdraw(recipient, stream_ids: Vec<u64>)` | recipient | `i128` total |
| `cancel(stream_id)` | sender | — |
| `pause(stream_id)` / `resume(stream_id)` | sender | — |
| `transfer_recipient(stream_id, new_recipient)` | recipient | — |

`withdraw` with `amount = None` draws the full available balance.

### Views — read-only, no TTL side effects

| function | returns |
|---|---|
| `get_stream(stream_id)` | `Stream` |
| `withdrawable_of(stream_id)` | `i128` |
| `vested_of(stream_id)` | `i128` |
| `refundable_of(stream_id)` | `i128` |
| `stream_count()` | `u64` — ids run `0..stream_count()` |
| `stream_exists(stream_id)` | `bool` |

### Maintenance — permissionless

| function | returns |
|---|---|
| `extend_stream_ttl(stream_id)` | `u32` ledgers now funded |
| `batch_extend_ttl(stream_ids: Vec<u64>)` | `u32` entries extended |

`MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 16` for both batch functions. Chunk client-side; the SDK does
this automatically. See [README](../README.md) for why the cap is 16 and why it
is derived from the *event* budget rather than the entry count.

---

## Events

Declared with `#[contractevent]`; schemas are in the deployed spec. Every event's
topic vector is `[symbol, stream_id, ...]` where `symbol` is the snake_case
struct name, followed by zero or more routing topics in the order shown.

### Topic positions

Positions are absolute, so an indexer can address a topic by index without
decoding the payload. `—` means the event has no topic at that index.

| event | topic[0] | topic[1] | topic[2] | topic[3] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stream_created` | `stream_created` | `stream_id` | `sender` | `recipient` |
| `withdrawn` | `withdrawn` | `stream_id` | `recipient` | — |
| `cancelled` | `cancelled` | `stream_id` | `sender` | `recipient` |
| `paused` | `paused` | `stream_id` | `sender` | — |
| `resumed` | `resumed` | `stream_id` | `sender` | — |
| `topped_up` | `topped_up` | `stream_id` | `sender` | — |
| `recipient_transferred` | `recipient_transferred` | `stream_id` | `old_recipient` | `new_recipient` |
| `delegate_granted` | `delegate_granted` | `stream_id` | `grantor` | `delegate` |
| `delegate_revoked` | `delegate_revoked` | `stream_id` | `grantor` | `delegate` |
| `ttl_extended` | `ttl_extended` | `stream_id` | — | — |

`topic[1]` is `stream_id` for **all ten** events without exception, which is
what makes a single "all events for stream N" filter possible. Topic arity
varies from 2 to 4 depending on how many parties the event routes on, so a
consumer must not assume four topics.

### Ordering rule

Topics are ordered by *role*, not by a fixed global pattern:

1. `stream_id` — always first, because it is the only universal join key.
2. The **initiating party** (`sender`, `grantor`).
3. The **counterparty**, when the event describes a relationship rather than a
   unilateral action (`recipient`, `delegate`, `new_recipient`).

Events that only one party acts on (`paused`, `resumed`, `topped_up`) stop
after topic[2]. `ttl_extended` is a keeper maintenance event with no party in
it at all, so it carries `stream_id` alone.

`recipient_transferred` is deliberately `old_recipient` then `new_recipient`:
an indexer filtering "streams where X is the new recipient" must be able to
target topic[3] without also matching every stream where X is the old one.
Reversing those two would silently break that filter.

### Payloads

| event | topics after the name | payload |
|---|---|---|
| `stream_created` | `stream_id`, `sender`, `recipient` | `token`, `deposited`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `cliff_time`, `cancellable`, `pausable`, `transferable` |
| `withdrawn` | `stream_id`, `recipient` | `amount`, `withdrawn`, `deposited`, `status` |
| `cancelled` | `stream_id`, `sender`, `recipient` | `refunded`, `vested`, `withdrawn`, `end_time` |
| `paused` | `stream_id`, `sender` | `paused_at`, `paused_total` |
| `resumed` | `stream_id`, `sender` | `paused_duration`, `paused_total` |
| `topped_up` | `stream_id`, `sender` | `amount`, `deposited`, `end_time` |
| `recipient_transferred` | `stream_id`, `old_recipient`, `new_recipient` | — |
| `delegate_granted` | `stream_id`, `grantor`, `delegate` | `ops`, `expires_at` |
| `delegate_revoked` | `stream_id`, `grantor`, `delegate` | — |
| `ttl_extended` | `stream_id` | `extended_to_ledgers` |

`stream_created` is the bootstrap event indexers use to reconstruct a stream's
initial state. It is the only source of the per-stream metadata needed to build
a sender/recipient mapping before any later lifecycle event arrives.

`recipient_transferred` and `delegate_revoked` carry an empty payload: every
field they route on is already a topic, so there is nothing left to put in the
data slot.

Every payload carries enough state to reconstruct the stream without replaying
from genesis. Field order and topic placement are ABI.

Note that `batch_withdraw` emits one `withdrawn` event **per stream drawn from**,
not one per call, and skips streams with nothing available — so a batch of 16
may emit fewer than 16 events.

## Resolved schema questions

Both were open against `Perpetua-Backend` in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) §5
and are settled here as part of the freeze.

### 1. `streams.status` — mirror the contract's four values verbatim

The backend's current CHECK constraint is
`('active','paused','completed','cancelled')`. The contract emits
`Active | Paused | Cancelled | Depleted`.

**Resolution: rename `completed` to `depleted` and use the contract's four names
as-is.** Do not map `Depleted` onto `completed`.

The tempting mapping is lossy in a way that matters. `Cancelled` is sticky, so a
cancelled stream that is later drained to zero stays `Cancelled` — it never
becomes `Depleted`. The two terminal states therefore answer different
questions: `Depleted` means "ran to term and the recipient took everything",
`Cancelled` means "the sender clawed back the remainder", regardless of whether
the recipient has since collected their share. Collapsing them, or introducing a
third name that exists only in the database, guarantees the projection and the
chain disagree the first time someone reports on completion rates.

Migration for the backend:

```sql
ALTER TABLE streams DROP CONSTRAINT streams_status_check;
UPDATE streams SET status = 'depleted' WHERE status = 'completed';
ALTER TABLE streams ADD CONSTRAINT streams_status_check
  CHECK (status IN ('active','paused','cancelled','depleted'));
```

The status discriminant in the `withdrawn` event is the authoritative source for
a stream reaching a terminal state; `cancelled` and `stream_created` cover the
rest.

### 2. `rate_per_second` — derived by the client, no on-chain view

**Resolution: the client derives it. We do not add a `rate_of()` view.**

```
rate_per_second = deposited / (end_time - start_time)      // integer, truncating
```

The reasoning, and the cost of being wrong, both matter here because the
contract is immutable — *adding this view later is impossible without
redeploying to a new address*.

Against adding it: it carries zero information. `get_stream` already returns
`deposited`, `start_time` and `end_time`, so a view would be pure convenience
occupying permanent surface on an immutable contract. Worse, "rate" is genuinely
ambiguous while a stream is paused — the instantaneous rate is zero, the
schedule rate is unchanged — and a single view would have to pick one and be
wrong for half its callers.

For deriving it: the formula is stable by construction. `top_up` holds the rate
fixed by design (it extends `end_time` instead of raising the rate), so the
derived value does not move across a top-up. After `cancel` it becomes
meaningless, which is correct — a cancelled stream has no rate.

**The backend's `streams.rate_per_second` column should become a generated or
computed value, not a stored one fed from an event.** No event carries a rate,
and none will.

**Requirement on `fluxora-sdk`, before stage 5.** The SDK must ship the
canonical derivation as a single exported function, and integrators must be
directed to it rather than to the formula. Declining to add an on-chain view
only avoids the ambiguity if exactly one implementation exists downstream; if
three integrators write three slightly different rate calculations — differing
on the paused case, or on cancelled streams, or on truncation — then we have
exported the ambiguity instead of resolving it, which is strictly worse than
having added the view.

The SDK's implementation is normative and must define, at minimum:

| case | value |
|---|---|
| active | `deposited / (end_time - start_time)`, truncating |
| paused | the schedule rate is unchanged; the *instantaneous* rate is zero. The SDK must expose these as two distinct, named quantities rather than one ambiguous `rate`. |
| cancelled | undefined — return `None`, not zero. A cancelled stream has no rate, and zero would be indistinguishable from a paused stream to a caller that ignores status. |
| after `top_up` | unchanged by construction; `top_up` extends `end_time` instead of raising the rate |

Link back to this table from the SDK's own documentation so the two cannot
drift.

---

## Client requirements

Two are non-negotiable for stage 5, both learned the hard way against live
testnet.

**1. Pin multi-view reads to a single ledger.** The public RPC endpoint is
load-balanced across nodes at different heights, and consecutive calls can
observe different ledgers — including apparently going backwards in time. Two
view calls combined into one derived figure (for example checking
`vested_of + refundable_of == deposited`) will intermittently disagree. See
[soroban-rpc-read-skew.md](soroban-rpc-read-skew.md).

**2. Handle archived streams.** `stream_exists(id) == false` while
`id < stream_count()` means the entry has been archived, not that it never
existed. Surface a restore action rather than an error. The recovery workflow is:

1. Check `stream_count()` and `stream_exists(id)` in one ledger snapshot.
2. If `!stream_exists(id)` and `id < stream_count()`, treat it as archived.
3. Tell the user the stream is archived and show a restore action.
4. Re-submit the read or mutating call with a `RestoreFootprint` so the
   persistent entry is recovered before retrying.
5. After the restore succeeds, re-run the call and continue normally.

See [KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) §1.

## Cliff Vesting Semantics vs Delayed Start Schedules

Perpetua enforces standard vesting semantics: `cliff_time` **gates** the payout; it does **not** delay the accrual schedule.

### Step Entitlement at the Cliff Boundary

- **Prior to the cliff (`now < cliff_time`, e.g. `cliff_time - 1`):** Entitlement is strictly `0`. Attempting to call `withdraw` returns `Error::NothingToWithdraw`.
- **At the cliff instant (`now == cliff_time`):** The cliff gate opens in a single discrete step. The recipient becomes immediately entitled to all tokens accrued since `start_time` (i.e. `deposited * (cliff_time - start_time) / (end_time - start_time)`), not merely what would accrue during the single second since `cliff_time - 1`.
- **Post-cliff continuous accrual (`now > cliff_time`):** Accrual proceeds linearly from `start_time` to `end_time` at the constant per-second rate.

### Comparison: Cliff Schedule vs Delayed Start Schedule

| Dimension | Cliff Schedule (`cliff_time > start_time`) | Delayed Start Schedule (`start_time > creation_time`) |
|---|---|---|
| Accrual Origin | Accrues continuously starting from `start_time` | Accrual begins only when `start_time` arrives |
| Payout Availability | Locked at `0` until `cliff_time` is reached | Locked at `0` until `start_time` is reached |
| Entitlement at Release | Lump-sum step: $(cliff\_time - start\_time) \times rate$ | `0` at start instant; accrues linearly thereafter |
| Post-Release Pace | Continues continuous accrual at original rate | Continues continuous accrual at original rate |

### Developer Integration Example

```typescript
// Example: Creating and verifying a cliff-gated stream with the Perpetua SDK
import { PerpetuaClient } from "@perpetua/sdk";

// 1. Create a stream with a 90-day cliff on a 360-day schedule
const startTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const cliffTime = startTime + 90 * 86400; // 90-day cliff
const endTime = startTime + 360 * 86400;   // 360-day total duration
const deposit = 1200_0000000n;            // 1,200 tokens (7 decimals)

const streamId = await client.createStream({
  sender: senderAddress,
  recipient: recipientAddress,
  token: tokenAddress,
  deposit,
  startTime,
  endTime,
  cliffTime,
  cancellable: true,
  pausable: true,
  transferable: true,
});

// 2. Querying entitlement before the cliff
// At cliffTime - 1: withdrawable amount is 0
const preCliff = await client.withdrawableOf(streamId, { timestamp: cliffTime - 1 });
console.log(`Withdrawable before cliff: ${preCliff}`); // Output: 0

// 3. Querying entitlement at the cliff instant
// At cliffTime: recipient can withdraw 1/4 of total deposit (90 / 360) = 300 tokens
const atCliff = await client.withdrawableOf(streamId, { timestamp: cliffTime });
console.log(`Withdrawable at cliff: ${atCliff}`); // Output: 300_0000000n

// 4. Executing withdrawal at cliff instant
const tx = await client.withdraw(streamId);
console.log(`Withdrawn: ${tx.amount}`); // Successfully claims 300 tokens
```
