//! Conservation invariant checker for the stream contract.
//!
//! The core invariant of Perpetua is exact balance conservation:
//!
//! ```text
//! vested(t) + refundable(t) == deposited      for all t
//! ```
//!
//! Any violation means the contract's balance could drift from its actual
//! accounting liability, leading to insolvency or locked funds. This module
//! provides a single reusable checker that unit tests and proptests can call
//! *before and after* every state-modifying transaction, so a breach panics
//! immediately with a clear message rather than surfacing later as a mysterious
//! shortfall.
//!
//! The checker is deliberately pure and host-free: it drives [`crate::accrual`]
//! directly, so it can be invoked from the cheap property tests as well as from
//! full contract tests without paying for a host invocation.

/// the exact step that introduced it.

/// * `Paused` — accrual is frozen at `paused_at`, so the same identity must
///   still hold against the frozen clock.

/// * `Depleted` — everything has vested, so `refundable` must be exactly zero.
